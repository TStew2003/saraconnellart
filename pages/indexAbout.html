                    <p> Growing up in Italy and Denmark, European tradition had a tremendous influence on me. My family are all artists of a type – shoe designer, architect, handbag designer. Having these influences allowed me to explore many mediums.
                        <p>Travel and training only strengthened my desire to paint. Many great artists struck my imagination. Caravaggio’s sense of realism and play with light as well as the combination of realism and high art of Klimt really made an impression on me.</p> 
                        <p>But perhaps the greatest influence in my artistic career was a beloved teacher in Italy, Professore Pierleoni. He truly helped me develop as an artist. I owe him much thanks.</p>
